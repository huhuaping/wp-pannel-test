# Pannel test method {#sec:1}


## Pesaran method {#sec:2}

[@pesaran2013] extends Pesaran’s **CIP** test to the case of a multifactor error structure. This is a non-trivial yet important extension which is much more broadly applicable. It has also the advantage of being intuitive and simple to implement. Following Bai and Ng (2010) we also consider a panel unit root test based on simple averages of cross-sectionally augmented Sargan–Bhargava type statistics, which we denote by **CSB**. The presence of multiple unobserved factors poses a number of additional challenges.

### Panel data model and the CIPs test 

Let $\Delta y_{it}$ be the observation on the $i$th cross section unit at time $t$, and suppose that it is generated as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta y_{i t}&=\beta_i\left(y_{i, t-1}-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i y}^{\prime} \mathbf{d}_{t-1}\right)+\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i y}^{\prime} \Delta \mathbf{d}_t+u_{i t}, \\
i&=1,2, \ldots, N ; t=1,2, \ldots, T
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-dgp}

Consider the following multifactor error structure 
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_{i t}=\gamma_{i y}^{\prime} \mathbf{f}_t+\varepsilon_{i y t}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-uit}

This set up generalises Pesaran’s [-@pesaran2007] one factor error specification (see @eq-uit). 

The main assumptions on these error processes are:

**Assumption 1: Idiosyncratic Errors**. The idiosyncratic shocks are independently distributed both across $i$ and $t$ , with zero means, variances $\sigma^2_i$,  and finite fourth-order moments.

**Assumption 2: Factors**. The Factors vector follows a covariance stationary process, with absolute summable autocovariances, distributed independently of Idiosyncratic Errors for all $i,t$ and $t'$.

Combining @eq-dgp and @eq-uit it follows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta y_{i t}=\beta_i\left(y_{i, t-1}-\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i y}^{\prime} \mathbf{d}_{t-1}\right)+\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i y}^{\prime} \Delta \mathbf{d}_t+\boldsymbol{\gamma}_{i y}^{\prime} \mathbf{f}_t+\varepsilon_{i y t}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-full}
