  abstract = {Purpose This study examines whether the law of one price (LOP) or price convergence holds during the COVID-19 pandemic for essential food items in India. Design/methodology/approach The authors use the daily retail price data of 22 essential food items from 103 Indian markets for two years (2019 as pre-COVID and 2020 as COVID period). Pesaran's (2007) second-generation panel unit-root test has been used to examine the price convergence of essential food commodities across various markets of different zones in the pre-COVID and COVID periods. Findings The authors find a tendency toward the convergence of prices across the spatially segregated markets for essential products. But, during the COVID period, there is a weak or no convergence of prices for essential food items. Hence, the LOP does not hold during the pandemic, indicating massive price deviations for food items across Indian markets. This has severe implications for food security as enormous price increases in some markets have been evidenced during the pandemic. Research limitations/implications The study calls for immediate policy adoption to restore the disrupted supply chain of essential food items. Along with that, the public authority should strictly prohibit black marketing and unlawful hoarding of essential food items. In addition, farmers should be provided direct cash benefits for restoring their farming activities. Originality/value This paper is first study to examine that hypothesis of LOP in the context of COVID crisis.},

We refer to it as PANIC\textemdash Panel Analysis of Nonstationarity in Idiosyncratic and Common components. PANIC can detect whether the nonstationarity in a series is pervasive, or variable-specific, or both. It can determine the number of independent stochastic trends driving the common factors. PANIC also permits valid pooling of individual statistics and thus panel tests can be constructed. A distinctive feature of PANIC is that it tests the unobserved components of the data instead of the observed series. The key to PANIC is consistent estimation of the space spanned by the unobserved common factors and the idiosyncratic errors without knowing a priori whether these are stationary or integrated processes. We provide a rigorous theory for estimation and inference and show that the tests have good finite sample properties.},

However, there remain many ways to use the defactored residuals to construct a test. In this paper, we use the panel analysis of nonstationarity in idiosyncratic and common components (PANIC) residuals to form two new tests. One estimates the pooled autoregressive coefficient, and one simply uses a sample moment. We establish their large-sample properties using a joint limit theory. We find that when the pooled autoregressive root is estimated using data detrended by least squares, the tests have no power. This result holds regardless of how the data are defactored. All PANIC-based pooled tests have nontrivial power because of the way the linear trend is removed.},

Our procedure is based on a factor representation, where we determine whether there are (and how many) common factors (i) with linear trends, and (ii) with stochastic trends. Cointegration among the factors is also permitted. Our analysis is based on the fact that those largest eigenvalues of a suitably scaled covariance matrix of the data corresponding to the common factor part diverge, as the dimension N of the dataset diverges, whilst the others stay bounded. Therefore, we propose a class of randomized test statistics for the null that the pth largest eigenvalue diverges, based directly on the estimated eigenvalue. The tests only requires minimal assumptions on the data-generating process. Monte Carlo evidence shows that our procedure has very good finite sample properties, clearly dominating competing approaches when no common trends are present. We illustrate our methodology through an application to the U.S. bond yields with different maturities observed over the last 30 years.},

Remarkably, we also find that the cross-dependence between municipalities in the Mexican region is highly correlated to public mobility, which plays the leading role behind the rhythm of contagion. Our findings are particularly revealing given that the Mexico City Metropolitan Area did not experience a decrease in air pollution during COVID-19 induced lockdowns.},

We use World Food Programme price data from 774 retail markets in 44 low and middle-income countries to test whether and how food prices have been affected by the stringency of COVID-19 containment measures. We assess market segmentation based on pre-COVID-19 price data and measure government responses using the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. Our results show that more stringent policy responses increase food prices for integrated markets but not for segmented markets. The impact of the stringency of policy responses on food prices seems to be mediated by reductions in mobility and moderated by the dependence of markets on trade before COVID-19.},

We establish consistency and derive the asymptotic distribution of the new quantile regression estimator. Monte Carlo studies are carried out to study the small sample behavior of the proposed approach. The evidence shows that the estimator can significantly improve on the performance of existing estimators as long as the time series dimension of the panel is large.

Our interest in this method originates with the fact it does not require explicit demeaning of the data, a practice that is known to cause problems of bias and low power in near unit root panels. The purpose is to study the properties of FA when applied to such panels when the common component admits to a interactive effects representation, which is more general than fixed effects. It is shown that the estimator of the autoregressive parameter is consistent with a well centered asymptotic normal distribution, leading to unit root tests with maximal achievable power. In fact, FA is consistent and asymptotically normal regardless of whether the data are near unit root non-stationary or stationary. It is therefore very general and hence widely applicable.},

In this paper we propose a simple alternative where the standard augmented Dickey\textendash Fuller (ADF) regressions are augmented with the cross-section averages of lagged levels and first-differences of the individual series. New asymptotic results are obtained both for the individual cross-sectionally augmented ADF (CADF) statistics and for their simple averages. It is shown that the individual CADF statistics are asymptotically similar and do not depend on the factor loadings. The limit distribution of the average CADF statistic is shown to exist and its critical values are tabulated. Small sample properties of the proposed test are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments.
